The rapidtide package
=====================

Rapidtide is a suite of Python programs used to model, characterize, 
visualize, and remove time varying, physiological blood signals from fMRI and fNIRS 
datasets.  The primary workhorses of the package are the rapidtide program, 
which characterizes bulk blood flow, and happy, which focusses on the cardiac
band.
