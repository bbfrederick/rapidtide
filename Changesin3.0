# Release history

## Version 3.0RC1 (4/8/25)
rapidtide:
* Reorganized and renamed some command line options and adjusted the default values - NOTE: some of these are breaking changes - where possible, I've added deprecation warnings.
* Rationalized handling of zero-mean data - now use the ``--dataiszeromean`` argument to tell rapidtide how to make masks.  ``--globalmaskmethod`` no longer exists.
* Mask setting has been streamlined and made somewhat more robust.  This should give you better fits with less tweaking.
* I've implemented a new delay refinement step using the ratio of linear fit coefficients.  This seems to be very robust and powerful to improve delay estimation, so this will trickle into other new functions over time.
* Enhanced fit failure reporting, to make debugging bad fits a bit easier.
* The ``--fixdelay`` option has been split into two options.  ``--initialdelay DELAY`` lets you specify either a float that sets the starting delay for every voxel to that value, or a 3D file specifying the initial delay for each voxel.  ``--nodelayfit`` determines whether the delay can be adjusted from its initial value.  Closes https://github.com/bbfrederick/rapidtide/issues/171. KNOWN ISSUE:  If you supply an initial delay map, instead of using the global mean, rapidtide should use the delays to make your first stage regressor.  Currently that is not the case.
* Now outputs a map of fit significance (-log10(p)).  In response to https://github.com/bbfrederick/rapidtide/issues/174.

happy:
* Trying out some new approaches for aliased correlation.
* Put in some initial support for multiecho data.
* Fixed a major bug in motion filtering (thank you to Sukru Demiral for reporting it!)

tidepool:
* You can now load multiple datasets from the command line using  ``--dataset DATASET1 DATASET2...``.  You can add datasets and switch between them using the File menu.
* Added a new "big" template to let you see more information at once.  Select with ``--uistyle big``.
* Supports pyqt6.
* Lots of bug fixes, code cleanup, and QOL improvements.

* (atlasaverage) Added the ability to segment a template atlas based on values of the map being summarized.
* (reference) Constructed a new version of the JHU LVL1 atlas where each territory is split into an early and late subterritory, based on the median delay in the HCP-YA dataset.

Documentation:
* Expanded the rapidtide theory of operation section a lot.
* Significantly beefed up happy section.
* tidepool's documentation has been expanded and updated to reflect the new capabilities.
* General cleanup and revision to match the current state of the package.
