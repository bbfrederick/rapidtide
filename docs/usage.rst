Background
----------
Before talking about the individual programs, in the 2.0 release and going
forward, I've tried to adhere to some common principals, across all program,
to make them easier to understand and maintain, and more interoperable
with other programs, and to simplify using the outputs.

BIDS Outputs
^^^^^^^^^^^^
By default, all outputs are in BIDS compatible formats (this is most true
for rapidtide and happy, which get the majority of the work, but the goal
is to eventually make all the programs in the package conform to this).  The
two major ramifications of this are that I have tried to follow BIDS naming
conventions for NIFTI, json, and text files containing time series.  Also,
all text files are by default BIDS continuous timeseries files - data is
in compressed, tab separated column format (.tsv.gz), with the column names,
sample rate, and start time, in the accompanying .json sidecar file.

Text Inputs
^^^^^^^^^^^
A side effect of moving to BIDS is that I've now made a standardized interface
for reading text data into programs in the package to handle many different
types of file.  In general, now if you
are asked for a timeseries, you can supply it in any of the following ways:

A plain text file with one or more columns.
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
You can specify any subset of
columns in any order by adding ":colspec" to the end of the filename.  "colspec"
is a column specification consisting of one or more comma separated "column
ranges".  A "column range" is either a single column number or a hyphen
separated minimum and maximum column number.  The first column in a file is
column 0.

For example specifying, "mytextfile.txt:5-6,2,0,10-12"

would return an array containing all the timepoints from columns 5, 6, 2, 0, 10, 11, and 12
from mytextfile.txt, in that order.  Not specifying ":colspec" returns all
the columns in the file, in order.

If the program in question requires the actual sample rate, this can be specified
using the ``--samplerate`` or ``--sampletime`` flags.  Otherwise 1.0Hz is assumed.

A BIDS continuous file with one or more columns.
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
BIDS files have names for each column, so these are used in column specification.
For these files, "colspec" is a comma separated list of one or more column
names:

"thefile_desc-interestingtimeseries_physio.json:cardiac,respiration"

would return the two named columns "cardiac" and "respiration" from the
accompanying .tsv.gz file.
Not specifying ":colspec" returns all the columns in the file, in order.

Because BIDS continuous files require sample rate and start time to be specified
in the sidecar file, these quantities will now already be set.  Using the
``--samplerate``, ``--sampletime`` or ``--starttime`` flags will override any header
values, if specified.

Visualizing files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Any output NIFTI file can be visualized in your favorite NIFTI viewer.  I like
FSLeyes, part of FSL.  It's flexible and fast, and has lots of options for
displaying 3 and 4D NIFTI files.

While there may be nice, general graphing tools for BIDS timeseries files, I
wrote "showtc" many years ago, a matplotlib based file viewer with lots of
nice tweaks to make pretty and informative graphs of various rapidtide input
and output files.  It's part of rapidtide, and pretty easy to learn.  Just
type "showtc" with no arguments to get the options.

As an example, after running happy, if you want to see the derived cardiac
waveform, you'd run:

::

  showtc \
      happytest_desc-slicerescardfromfmri_timeseries.json:cardiacfromfmri,cardiacfromfmri_dlfiltered \
      --format separate



rapidtide
---------

Description:
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The central program in this package is rapidtide.  This is the program that
calculates a similarity function between a "probe" signal and every voxel of
a BOLD fMRI dataset.  It then determines the peak value, time delay, and wi
dth of the similarity function to determine when and how strongly that probe
signal appears in each voxel.

At its core, rapidtide is simply performing a full crosscorrelation between a
"probe" timecourse and every voxel in an fMRI dataset (by “full” I mean over
a range of time lags that account for any delays between the signals, rather
than only at zero lag, as in a Pearson correlation).  As with many things,
however, the devil is in the details, and so rapidtide provides a number of
features which make it pretty good at this particular task.  A few highlights:

* There are lots of ways to do something even as simple as a cross-correlation in a nonoptimal way (not windowing, improper normalization, doing it in the time rather than frequency domain, etc.).  I'm pretty sure what rapidtide does by default is, if not the best way, at least a very good and very fast way.
* rapidtide has been optimized and profiled to speed it up quite a bit; it has an optional dependency on numba – if it’s installed, some of the most heavily used routines will speed up significantly due to judicious use of @jit.
* The sample rate of your probe regressor and the fMRI data do not have to match - rapidtide resamples the probe regressor to an integral multiple of the fMRI data rate automatically.
* The probe and data can be temporally prefiltered to the LFO, respiratory, or cardiac frequency band with a command line switch, or you can specify any low, high, or bandpass range you want.
* The data can be spatially smoothed at runtime (so you don't have to keep smoothed versions of big datasets around).  This is quite fast, so no reason not to do it this way.
* rapidtide can generate a probe regressor from the global mean of the data itself - no externally recorded timecourse is required.  Optionally you can input both a mask of regions that you want to be included in the mean, and the voxels that you want excluded from the mean (there are situations when you might want to do one or the other or both).
* Determining the significance threshold for filtered correlations where the optimal delay has been selected is nontrivial; using the conventional formulae for the significance of a correlation leads to wildly inflated p values.  rapidtide estimates the spurious correlation threshold by calculating the distribution of null correlation values obtained with a shuffling  procedure at the beginning of each run (the default is to use 10000 shuffled correlations), and uses this value to mask the correlation maps it calculates.  As of version 0.1.2 it will also handle two-tailed significance, which you need when using bipolar mode.
* rapidtide can do an iterative refinement of the probe regressor by aligning the voxel timecourses in time and regenerating the test regressor.
* rapidtide fits the peak of the correlation function, so you can make fine grained distinctions between close lag times. The resolution of the time lag discrimination is set by the length of the timecourse, not the timestep – this is a feature of correlations, not rapidtide.
* Once the time delay in each voxel has been found, rapidtide outputs a 4D file of delayed probe regressors for using as voxel specific confound regressors or to estimate the strength of the probe regressor in each voxel.  This regression is performed by default, but these outputs let you do it yourself if you are so inclined.
* I've put a lot of effort into making the outputs as informative as possible - lots of useful maps, histograms, timecourses, etc.
* There are a lot of tuning parameters you can mess with if you feel the need.  I've tried to make intelligent defaults so things will work well out of the box, but you have the ability to set most of the interesting parameters yourself.

Inputs:
^^^^^^^

At a minimum, rapidtide needs a data file to work on (space by time), which is generally thought to be a BOLD fMRI data file.  This can be Nifti1 or Nifti2 (for fMRI data, in which case it is time by up to 3 spatial dimensions) or a whitespace separated text file (for NIRS data, each column is a time course, each row a separate channel); I can currently read (probably) but not write Cifti files, so if you want to use grayordinate files you need to convert them to nifti2 in workbench, run rapidtide, then convert back. As soon as nibabel finishes their Cifti support (EDIT: and I get around to figuring it out), I'll add that.

The file needs one time dimension and at least one spatial dimension.  Internally, the array is flattened to a time by voxel array for simplicity.

The file you input here should be the result of any preprocessing you intend to do.  The expectation is that rapidtide will be run as the last preprocessing step before resting state or task based analysis.  So any slice time correction, motion correction, spike removal, etc. should already have been done.  If you use FSL, this means that if you've run preprocessing, you would use the filtered_func_data.nii.gz file as input.  Temporal and spatial filtering are the two (partial) exceptions here.  Generally rapidtide is most useful for looking at low frequency oscillations, so when you run it, you usually use the ``--filterband lfo`` option or some other to limit the analysis to the detection and removal of low frequency systemic physiological oscillations.  So rapidtide will generally apply it's own temporal filtering on top of whatever you do in preprocessing.  Also, you have the option of doing spatial smoothing in rapidtide to boost the SNR of the analysis; the hemodynamic signals rapidtide looks for are often very smooth, so you rather than smooth your functional data excessively, you can do it within rapidtide so that only the hemodynamic data is smoothed at that level.

Outputs:
^^^^^^^^

Outputs are space or space by time NIFTI or text files, depending on what the input data file was, and some text files containing textual information, histograms, or numbers.  File formats and naming follow BIDS conventions for derivative data for fMRI input data.  Output spatial dimensions and file type match the input dimensions and file type (Nifti1 in, Nifti1 out).  Depending on the file type of map, there can be no time dimension, a time dimension that matches the input file, or something else, such as a time lag dimension for a correlation map.

                                           analysis will go to the last timepoint.  Negative values
                                           of START will be set to 0. Default is to use all timepoints.
          --nothresh                     - Disable voxel intensity threshold (especially useful
                                           for NIRS data)
          --motionfile=MOTFILE[:COLSPEC] - Read 6 columns of motion regressors out of MOTFILE text file.
                                           (with timepoints rows) and regress their derivatives
                                           and delayed derivatives out of the data prior to analysis.
                                           If COLSPEC is present, use the comma separated list of ranges to
                                           specify X, Y, Z, RotX, RotY, and RotZ, in that order.  For
                                           example, :3-5,7,0,9 would use columns 3, 4, 5, 7, 0 and 9
                                           for X, Y, Z, RotX, RotY, RotZ, respectively
          --motpos                       - Toggle whether displacement regressors will be used in motion regression.

          --regressor=FILENAME           - Read probe regressor from file FILENAME (if none
                                           specified, generate and use global regressor)

                                           (default is 'gauss'). 'quad' uses a quadratic fit. Other options are
                                           'fastgauss' which is faster but not as well tested, and 'None'.
          --despecklepasses=PASSES       - detect and refit suspect correlations to disambiguate peak

                                           at an edge of the range.

      Regressor refinement options:

                                           to refinement (valid weightings are 'None',
                                           'mean' (default), 'var', and 'std'
          --refineweighting=TYPE         - Apply TYPE weighting to each timecourse prior
                                           to refinement (valid weightings are 'None',

                                           NB: refinepasses is the wrong name for this option -
                                           --refinepasses is deprecated, use --passes from now on.
          --refineinclude=MASK[:VALSPEC] - Only use nonzero voxels in MASK for regressor refinement (if VALSPEC is
                                           given, only voxels with integral values listed in VALSPEC are used.)

                                           coefficients less than AMP (default is 0.3).  NOTE: ampthresh will
                                           automatically be set to the p<0.05 significance level determined by
                                           the -N option if -N is set greater than 0 and this is not

          --glmsourcefile=FILE           - Regress delayed regressors out of FILE instead of the

                                           from each voxel (disables output of fitNorm)
          --preservefiltering            - don't reread data prior to GLM

      Miscellaneous options:
          --noprogressbar                - Disable progress bars - useful if saving output to files
          --wiener                       - Perform Wiener deconvolution to get voxel transfer functions
          --usesp                        - Use single precision for internal calculations (may
                                           be useful when RAM is limited)

          --multiproc                    - Enable multiprocessing versions of key subroutines.  This
                                           speeds things up dramatically.  Almost certainly will NOT
                                           work on Windows (due to different forking behavior).
          --mklthreads=NTHREADS          - Use no more than NTHREADS worker threads in accelerated numpy calls.
          --nprocs=NPROCS                - Use NPROCS worker processes for multiprocessing.  Setting NPROCS
                                           less than 1 sets the number of worker processes to
                                           n_cpus - 1 (default).  Setting NPROCS enables --multiproc.
          --debug                        - Enable additional information output
          --saveoptionsasjson            - Save the options file in json format rather than text.  Will eventually
                                           become the default, but for now I'm just trying it out.

      Experimental options (not fully tested, may not work):
          --cleanrefined                 - perform additional processing on refined regressor to remove spurious
                                           components.
          --dispersioncalc               - Generate extra data during refinement to allow calculation of
                                           dispersion.
          --acfix                        - Perform a secondary correlation to disambiguate peak location
                                           (enables --accheck).  Experimental.
          --tmask=MASKFILE               - Only correlate during epochs specified in
                                           MASKFILE (NB: if file has one colum, the length needs to match
                                           the number of TRs used.  TRs with nonzero values will be used
                                           in analysis.  If there are 2 or more columns, each line of MASKFILE
                                           contains the time (first column) and duration (second column) of an
                                           epoch to include.)



These options are somewhat self-explanatory.  I will be expanding this section of the manual going forward, but I want to put something here to get this out here.

When using the legacy interface, file names will be output using the old, non-BIDS names and formats.  rapidtide can be forced to use the old style outputs with the ``--legacyoutput`` flag.

Examples:
^^^^^^^^^

Rapidtide can do many things - as I've found more interesting things to do with time delay processing, it's gained new functions and options to support these new applications.  As a result, it can be a little hard to know what to use for a new experiment.  To help with that, I've decided to add this section to the manual to get you started.  It's broken up by type of data/analysis you might want to do.


Removing low frequency physiological noise from resting state data
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This is what I thought most people would use rapidtide for - finding and removing the low frequency (LFO) signal from an existing dataset.  This presupposes you have not made a simultaneous physiological recording (well, you may have, but it assumes you aren't using it).  For this, you can use a minimal set of options, since the defaults are mostly right.

The base command you'd use would be:

	::

		rapidtide inputfmrifile outputname --frequencyband lfo --passes 3

This will do a fairly simple analysis.  First, the -L option means that rapidtide will prefilter the data to the LFO band (0.009-0.15Hz). It will then construct a regressor from the global mean of the signal in inputfmrifile (default behavior if no regressor is specified), and then use crosscorrelation to determine the time delay in each voxel.  The ``--passes=3`` option directs rapidtide to to perform the delay analysis 3 times, each time generating a new estimate of the global noise signal by aligning all of the timecourses in the data to bring the global signal in phase prior to averaging.  The ``--refineoffset`` flag recenters the peak of the delay distribution on zero during the refinement process, which should make datasets easier to compare.  After the three passes are complete, it will then use a GLM filter to remove a lagged copy of the final mean regressor that from the data - this denoised data will be in the file "outputname_filtereddata.nii.gz".  There will also a number of maps output with the prefix `"outputname_"` of delay, correlation strength and so on.

Mapping long time delays in response to a gas challenge experiment:
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Processing this sort of data requires a very different set of options from the previous case.  Instead of the distribution of delays you expect in healthy controls (a slightly skewed, somewhat normal distribution with a tail on the positive side, ranging from about -5 to 5 seconds), in this case, the maximum delay can be extremely long (100-120 seconds is not uncommon in stroke, moyamoya disesase, and atherosclerosis).  To do this, you need to radically change what options you use, not just the delay range, but a number of other options having to do with refinement and statistical measures.

For this type of analysis, a good place to start is the following:

	::

		rapidtide inputfmrifile outputname --numnull 0 --searchrange -10 140 --filterfreqs 0.0 0.1 --ampthresh 0.2 --noglm --nofitfilt

The first option (``--numnull 0``), shuts off the calculation of the null correlation distribution.  This is used to determine the significance threshold, but the method currently implemented in rapidtide is a bit simplistic - it assumes that all the time points in the data are exchangable.  This is certainly true for resting state data (see above), but it is very much NOT true for block paradigm gas challenges.  To properly analyze those, I need to consider what time points are 'equivalent', and up to now, I don't, so setting the number of iterations in the Monte Carlo analysis to zero omits this step.

The second option (``--searchrange -10 140``) is fairly obvious - this extends the detectable delay range out to 140 seconds.  Note that this is somewhat larger than the maximum delays we frequently see, but to find the correlation peak with maximum precision, you need sufficient additional delay values so that the correlation can come to a peak and then come down enough that you can properly fit it.

Setting ``--filterfreqs 0.0 0.1`` is VERY important.  By default, rapidtide assumes you are looking at endogenous low frequency oscillations, which typically between 0.09 and 0.15 Hz.  However, gas challenge paradigms are usually MUCH lower frequency (90 seconds off, 90 seconds on corresponds to 1/180s = ~0.006Hz).  So if you use the default frequency settings, you will completely filter out your stimulus, and presumably, your response.  If you are processing one of these experiments and get no results whatsoever, this is almost certainly the problem.

The ``--noglm`` option disables data filtering.  If you are using rapidtide to estimate and remove low frequency noise from resting state or task fMRI data, the last step is to use a glm filter to remove this circulatory signal, leaving "pure" neuronal signal, which you'll use in further analyses.  That's not relevant here - the signal you'd be removing is the one you care about. So this option skips that step to save time and disk space.

``--nofitfilt`` skips a step after peak estimation.  Estimating the delay and correlation amplitude in each voxel is a two step process. First you make a quick estimate (where is the maximum point of the correlation function, and what is its amplitude?), then you refine it by fitting a Gaussian function to the peak to improve the estimate.  If this step fails, which it can if the peak is too close to the end of the lag range, or strangely shaped, the default behavior is to mark the point as bad and zero out the parameters for the voxel.  The nofitfilt option means that if the fit fails, output the initial estimates rather than all zeros.   This means that you get some information, even if it's not fully refined.  In my experience it does tend to make the maps for the gas challenge experiments a lot cleaner to use this option since the correlation function is pretty well behaved.


Denoising NIRS data (NEW)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

When we started this whole research effort, I waw originally planning to denoise NIRS data, not fMRI data.  But one thing led to another, and the NIRS got derailed for the fMRI effort.  Now that we have some time to catch our breaths, and more importantly, we have access to some much higher quality NIRS data, this moved back to the front burner.  The majority of the work was already done, I just needed to account for a few qualities that make NIRS data different from fMRI data:

* NIRS data is not generally stored in NIFTI files.  There is not as yet a standard NIRS format.  In the absence of one, you could do worse than a multicolumn text file, with one column per data channel.  That's what I did here - if the file has a '.txt' extension rather than '.nii.', '.nii.gz', or no extension, it will assume all I/O should be done on multicolumn text files.
* NIRS data is often zero mean.  This turned out to mess with a lot of my assumptions about which voxels have significant data, and mask construction.  This has led to some new options for specifying mask threshholds and data averaging.
* NIRS data is in some sense "calibrated" as relative micromolar changes in oxy-, deoxy-, and total hemoglobin concentration, so mean and/or variance normalizing the timecourses may not be right thing to do.  I've added in some new options to mess with normalizations.


happy
-----

Description:
^^^^^^^^^^^^

happy is a new addition to the rapidtide suite.  It's complementary to rapidtide - it's focussed on fast, cardiac signals in fMRI, rather than the slow, LFO signals we are usually looking at.  It's sort of a Frankenprogram - it has three distinct jobs, which are related, but are very distinct.

The first thing happy does is try to extract a cardiac waveform from the fMRI data.  This is something I've been thinking about for a long time.  Words go here

The second task is to take this raw estimate of the cardiac waveform, and clean it up using a deep learning filter.  The original signal is useful, but pretty gross, but I figured you should be able to exploit the pseudoperiodic nature of the signal to greatly improve it.  This is also a testbed to work on using neural nets to process time domain signals.  It seemed like a worthwhile project, so it got grafted in.

The final task (which was actually the initial task, and the reason I wrote happy to begin with) is to implement Henning Voss' totally cool hypersampling with analytic phase projection (guess where the name "happy" comes from).  This is fairly straightforward, as Voss describes his method very clearly.  But I have lots of data with no simultaneously recorded cardiac signals, and I was too lazy to go find datasets with pleth data to play with, so that's why I did the cardiac waveform extraction part.


Inputs:
^^^^^^^
Happy needs a 4D BOLD fMRI data file (space by time) as input.  This can be Nifti1 or Nifti2.  If you have a simultaneously recorded cardiac waveform, it will happily use it, otherwise it will try to construct (and refine) one. NOTE: the 4D input dataset needs to be completely unpreprocessed - gradient distortion correction and motion correction can destroy the relationship between slice number and actual acquisition time, and slice time correction does not behave as expected for aliased signals (which the cardiac component in fMRI most certainly is), and in any case we need the slice time offsets to construct our waveform.


Outputs:
^^^^^^^^

Outputs are space or space by time Nifti or text files, depending on what the input data file was, and some text files containing textual information, histograms, or numbers.  File formats and naming follow BIDS conventions for derivative data for fMRI input data.  Output spatial dimensions and file type match the input dimensions and file type (Nifti1 in, Nifti1 out).  Depending on the file type of map, there can be no time dimension, a time dimension that matches the input file, or something else, such as a time lag dimension for a correlation map.

Extract the cardiac waveform and generate phase projections
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Case 1: When you don't have a pleth recording
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
There are substantial improvements to the latest versions of happy.
In the old versions, you actually had to run happy twice -
the first time to estimate the vessel locations, and the second
to actually derive the waveform.  Happy now combines these operations interpolation
a single run with multiple passes - the first
pass locates voxels with high variance, labels them as vessels, then reruns
the derivation, restricting the cardiac estimation to these high variance voxels.
This gives substantially better results.

Using the example data in the example directory, try the following:

  ::

    happy \
        rapidtide/data/examples/src/sub-HAPPYTEST.nii.gz \
        rapidtide/data/examples/src/sub-HAPPYTEST.json \
        rapidtide/data/examples/dst/happytest


This will perform a happy analysis on the example dataset.  To see the extracted
cardiac waveform (original and filtered), you can use showtc (also part of them
rapidtide package):

  ::

    showtc \
        rapidtide/data/examples/src/happytest_desc-slicerescardfromfmri_timeseries.json:cardiacfromfmri,cardiacfromfmri_dlfiltered \

	Like rapidtide, but for single time courses.  Takes two text files as input, calculates and displays
	the time lagged crosscorrelation between them, fits the maximum time lag, and estimates

showxcorrx
----------

Description:
^^^^^^^^^^^^

	This is the newest, most avant-garde version of showxcorr.  Because it's an x file, it's more fluid and I don't guarantee that it will keep a stable interface (or even work at any given time).  But every time I add something new, it goes here.  The goal is eventually to make this the "real" version.  Unlike rapidtide, however, I've let it drift quite a bit without syncing it because some people here actually use showxcorr and I don't want to disrupt workflows...

Inputs:
^^^^^^^
	showxcorrx requires two text files containing timecourses with the same sample rate, one timepoint per line, which are to be correlated, and the sample rate.

Outputs:
^^^^^^^^
	showxcorrx  outputs everything to standard out, including the Pearson correlation, the maximum cross correlation, the time of maximum cross correlation, and estimates of the significance levels (if specified).  There are no output files.

	A program to compare voxel values in two 3D NIFTI files.
        You give pixelcomp two files, each with their own mask.
        Any voxel that has a nonzero mask in both files gets added
        to a list of xy pairs, with the value from the first file being x,
        and the value from the second file being y.  Pixelcomp then:
        1) Makes and displays a 2D histogram of all the xy values. 2) Does a linear
        fit to x and y, and outputs the coefficients (slope and offset)
        to a XXX_linfit.txt file. 3) Writes all the xy pairs to a tab
        separated text file, and 4) Makes a Bland-Altman plot of x vs y

^^^^^^^

Outputs:
^^^^^^^^

Usage:
^^^^^^

	::

Description:
^^^^^^^^^^^^
	Calculate and display the short term crosscorrelation between two timeseries (useful for dynamic correlation).


Inputs:
^^^^^^^

Outputs:
^^^^^^^^

Usage:
^^^^^^

	::

		showstxcorr - calculate and display the short term crosscorrelation between two timeseries

		usage: showstxcorr -i timecoursefile1 [-i timecoursefile2] --samplefreq=FREQ -o outputfile [-l LABEL] [-s STARTTIME] [-D DURATION] [-d] [-F LOWERFREQ,UPPERFREQ[,LOWERSTOP,UPPERSTOP]] [-V] [-L] [-R] [-C] [--nodetrend] [-nowindow] [-f] [--phat] [--liang] [--eckart] [-z FILENAME]

		required arguments:
		    -i, --infile= timcoursefile1     - text file containing one or more timeseries
		    [-i, --infile= timcoursefile2]   - text file containing a timeseries
						       NB: if one timecourse file is specified, each column
						       is considered a timecourse, and there must be at least
						       2 columns in the file.  If two filenames are given, each
						       file must have only one column of data.

		    -o, --outfile=OUTNAME:           - the root name of the output files

		    --samplefreq=FREQ                - sample frequency of all timecourses is FREQ
			   or
		    --sampletime=TSTEP               - time step of all timecourses is TSTEP
						       NB: --samplefreq and --sampletime are two ways to specify
						       the same thing.

		optional arguments:
		    --nodetrend   - do not detrend the data before correlation
		    --nowindow    - do not prewindow data before corrlation
		    --phat        - perform phase alignment transform (PHAT) rather than

		    -R            - filter data and regressors to respiratory band
		    -C            - filter data and regressors to cardiac band
		    -W WINDOWLEN  - use a window length of WINDOWLEN seconds (default is 50.0s)
		    -S STEPSIZE   - timestep between subsequent measurements (default is 25.0s).  Will be rounded to the nearest sample time
		    -f            - negate second regressor


tidepool
--------

Description:
^^^^^^^^^^^^
	This is a very experimental tool for displaying all of the various maps generated by rapidtide in one place, overlayed on an anatomic image.  This makes it a bit easier to see how all the maps are related to one another.  To use it, launch tidepool from the command line, and then select a lag time map - tidpool will figure out the root name and pull in all of the other associated maps.  Works in native or standard space.


Inputs:
^^^^^^^

Outputs:
^^^^^^^^

Usage:
^^^^^^

	::

		usage: tidepool [-h] [-o OFFSETTIME] [-r] [-n] [-t TRVAL] [-d DATAFILEROOT]
					[-a ANATNAME] [-m GEOMASKNAME]

		A program to display the results of a time delay analysis

		optional arguments:
		  -h, --help       show this help message and exit
		  -o OFFSETTIME    Set lag offset
		  -r               enable risetime display
		  -n               enable movie mode
		  -t TRVAL         Set correlation TR
		  -d DATAFILEROOT  Use this dataset (skip initial selection step)
		  -a ANATNAME      Set anatomic mask image
		  -m GEOMASKNAME   Set geometric mask image
