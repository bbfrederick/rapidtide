   abstract = {Although the cerebellum is increasingly being viewed as a brain area involved in cognition, it typically is excluded from circuitry considered to mediate stimulant-associated behaviors since it is low in dopamine. Yet, the primate cerebellar vermis (lobules II-III and VIII-IX) has been reported to contain axonal dopamine transporter immunoreactivity (DAT-IR). We hypothesized that DAT-IR-containing vermis areas would be activated in cocaine abusers by cocaine-related cues and, in healthy humans, would accumulate DAT-selective ligands. We used BOLD fMRI to determine whether cocaine-related cues activated DAT-IR-enriched vermis regions in cocaine abusers and positron emission tomography imaging of healthy humans to determine whether the DAT-selective ligand [C-11] altropane accumulated in those vermis regions. Cocaine-related cues selectively induced BOLD activation in lobules II-III and VIII-IX in cocaine users, and, at early time points after ligand administration, we found appreciable [C-11] altropane accumulation in lobules VIII-IX, possibly indicating DAT presence in this region. These data suggest that parts of cerebellar vermis mediate cocaine's persisting and acute effects. In light of prior findings illustrating vermis connections to midbrain dopamine cell body regions, established roles for the vermis as a locus of sensorimotor integration and motor planning, and findings of increased vermis activation in substance abusers during reward-related and other cognitive tasks, we propose that the vermis be considered one of the structures involved in cocaine- and other incentive-related behaviors.},

   abstract = {Background: Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to determine the effects of intravenous cocaine or placebo administration on human basal ganglia water and metabolite resonances. Methods: Long echo time, proton magnetic resonance spectra of water and intracellular metabolites were continuously acquired from an 8-cm(3) voxel centered on the left caudate and putamen nuclei before, during, and after the intravenous administration of cocaine or a placebo in a double-blind manner. Results: Cocaine, at both 0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg, did not alter the peak area for water. Cocaine at 0.2 mg/kg induced small and reversible increases in choline-containing compounds and N-acetylaspartate peak areas. Cocaine at 0.4 mg/kg induced larger and more sustained increases in choline-containing compounds and N-acetylaspartate peak areas. No changes in either water or metabolite resonances were noted following placebo administration, Conclusions: These increases in choline-containing compounds and N-acetylaspartate peak areas may reflect increases in metabolite T2 relaxation times secondary to osmotic stress and/or increased phospholipid signaling within the basal ganglia following cocaine administration. This is the first report of acute, drug-induced changes in the intensity of human brain proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy resonance areas. (C) 2000 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: To compare cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) and CVR lagtimes in flow territories perfused by vessels with vs. without proximal arterial wall disease and/or stenosis, separately in patients with atherosclerotic and nonatherosclerotic (moyamoya) intracranial stenosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Atherosclerotic and moyamoya patients with >50% intracranial stenosis and <70% cervical stenosis underwent angiography, vessel wall imaging (VWI), and CVR-weighted imaging (n = 36; vessel segments evaluated = 396). Angiography and VWI were evaluated for stenosis locations and vessel wall lesions. Maximum CVR and CVR lagtime were contrasted between vascular territories with and without proximal intracranial vessel wall lesions and stenosis, and a Wilcoxon rank-sum was test used to determine differences (criteria: corrected two-sided P < 0.05). RESULTS: CVR lagtime was prolonged in territories with vs. without a proximal vessel wall lesion or stenosis for both patient groups: moyamoya (CVR lagtime = 45.5 sec +/- 14.2 sec vs. 35.7 sec +/- 9.7 sec, P < 0.001) and atherosclerosis (CVR lagtime = 38.2 sec +/- 9.1 sec vs. 35.0 sec +/- 7.2 sec, P = 0.001). For reactivity, a significant decrease in maximum CVR in the moyamoya group only (maximum CVR = 9.8 +/- 2.2 vs. 12.0 +/- 2.4, P < 0.001) was observed. CONCLUSION: Arterial vessel wall lesions detected on noninvasive, noncontrast intracranial VWI in patients with intracranial stenosis correlate on average with tissue-level impairment on CVR-weighted imaging.

   abstract = {Studies using a variety of investigative methods, including functional brain imaging and electroencephalography (EEG), have suggested that changes in central nervous system (CNS) dopamine function result in altered visual system processing. The discovery of abnormal retinal blue cone, but not red cone, electroretinogram in association with cocaine withdrawal and Parkinson's disease suggests that visual system response to blue light might be a marker for CNS dopamine tone. As there are numerous sex-related differences in central nervous system dopamine function, we predicted that blue and red light stimulation would produce sex-specific patterns of response in primary visual cortex when studied using the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technique. We analyzed the BOLD response to red and blue light in male and female human volunteers (N=20). Red and blue light responses in primary visual cortex (V1) to stepped intensities of red and blue light were compared by sex for threshold to detectable BOLD signal increase and for stimulus intensity vs. BOLD signal response. Near threshold, males and females showed similar BOLD signal change to red light, but males showed a threefold greater increase (0.52%) to blue light stimulation when compared to females (0.14%). Log-linear regression modeling revealed that the slope coefficients for the red light stimulus intensity vs. signal change curve were not significantly different for males and females (z=0.995, P=0.320), whereas the slope coefficients for the blue light stimulus intensity vs. signal change curve were significantly larger in males (z=2.251, P=0.024). These findings support a sex and color-dependent differential pattern of primary visual cortical response to photic stimulation and suggest a method for assessing the influence of specific dopamine agonist/antagonist medications on visual function.},

Human MDMA users have altered serotonergic function and reduced gray matter density in occipital cortex. The fMRI BOLD method is potentially sensitive to both the neuronal and vascular consequences of MDMA-induced serotonin toxicity. To test the hypothesis that MDMA users have altered visual system function, we used the fMRI BOLD technique to assay visual cortical activation after photic stimulation in a group of adult MDMA users. Because MDMA users worldwide are polydrug users and therefore difficult to match to comparison groups in terms of polydrug exposure, we conducted a primary within-group analysis examining the correlation between lifetime episodes of MDMA exposure and measures of visual cortical activation. The within-group correlational analysis in the MDMA user group revealed that the degree of prior MDMA exposure was significantly positively correlated with the number of activated pixels for photic stimulation (r=0.582, p=0.007). A secondary between-group comparison of MDMA users with non-MDMA users found overall greater levels of polydrug exposure in the MDMA user cohort but no significant differences in visual cortical activation measures between the two groups.

   abstract = {The neurotransmitter dopamine (DA) is implicated in the pathophysiology of central nervous system (CNS) illnesses including Parkinson's disease, attention deficit disorder, schizophrenia, and substance abuse. A better understanding of CNS DA function would be of importance in improving our understanding of these conditions. Several lines of evidence suggest that exploring visual system function may be a useful paradigm for examining DA function. Clinical and basic science findings suggest that the visual response to blue light might prove a useful assay of CNS DA tone. To test this hypothesis, we used the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) BOLD method to measure visual cortical activation in human subjects (N = 6) in response to 8 Hz flashing red and blue light stimuli during placebo conditions and during the oral administration of 2.5 mg of D-amphetamine, a drug known to increase synaptic concentrations of DA and other monoamine neurotransmitters. There was no effect of D-amphetamine administration on the percent BOLD signal change to red or blue light. However, there was a specific augmentation of the spatial extent of activation (as measured by the number of activated pixels; P = 0.018) to blue, but not red light following D-amphetamine administration. This finding is consistent with our hypothesis that blue light function may have utility as an assay of CNS DA tone. However, several limitations to the study, including the small sample size, low dosage of D-amphetamine, and the fact that D-amphetamine increases synaptic concentrations of DA and other monoamine neurotransmitters do not permit a conclusion regarding a specific role for DA in the observed increase in spatial activation to blue light in the amphetamine condition.},

   abstract = {The neurotransmitter dopamine (DA) is implicated in the pathophysiology of central nervous system (CNS) illnesses including Parkinson's disease, attention deficit disorder, schizophrenia, and substance abuse. A better understanding of CNS DA function would be of importance in improving our understanding of these conditions. Several lines of evidence suggest that exploring visual system function may be a useful paradigm for examining DA function. Clinical and basic science findings suggest that the visual response to blue light might prove a useful assay of CNS DA tone. To test this hypothesis, we used the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) BOLD method to measure visual cortical activation in human subjects (N = 6) in response to 8 Hz flashing red and blue light stimuli during placebo conditions and during the oral administration of 2.5 mg of D-amphetamine, a drug known to increase synaptic concentrations of DA and other monoamine neurotransmitters. There was no effect Of D-amphetamine administration on the percent BOLD signal change to red or blue light. However, there was a specific augmentation of the spatial extent of activation (as measured by the number of activated pixels; P = 0.018) to blue, but not red light following D-amphetamine administration. This finding is consistent with our hypothesis that blue light function may have utility as an assay of CNS DA tone. However, several limitations to the study, including the small sample size, low dosage of D-amphetamine, and the fact that D-amphetamine increases synaptic concentrations of DA and other monoamine neurotransmitters do not permit a conclusion regarding a specific role for DA in the observed increase in spatial activation to blue light in the amphetamine condition.},

PPD subjects showed attenuation of connectivity for each of the tested regions (i.e. ACC, AMYG, HIPP and DLPFC) and between corticocortical and corticolimbic regions vs. HCS.

   abstract = {Blood oxygenation level-dependent fMRI contrast depends on the volume and oxygenation of blood flowing through the circulatory system. The effects on image intensity depend temporally on the arrival of blood within a voxel, and signal can be monitored during the time course of such blood flow. It has been previously shown that the passage of global endogenous variations in blood volume and oxygenation can be tracked as blood passes through the brain by determining the strength and peak time lag of their cross-correlation with blood oxygenation level-dependent data. By manipulating blood composition using transient hypercarbia and hyperoxia, we can induce much larger oxygenation and volume changes in the blood oxygenation level-dependent signal than result from natural endogenous fluctuations. This technique was used to examine cerebrovascular parameters in healthy subjects (n = 8) and subjects with intracranial stenosis (n = 22), with a subgroup of intracranial stenosis subjects scanned before and after surgical revascularization (n = 6). The halfwidth of cross-correlation lag times in the brain was larger in IC stenosis subjects (21.21 +/- 14.22 s) than in healthy control subjects (8.03 +/- 3.67), p < 0.001, and was subsequently reduced in regions that co-localized with surgical revascularization. These data show that blood circulatory timing can be measured robustly and longitudinally throughout the brain using simple respiratory challenges.},

   abstract = {Resting state functional connectivity analysis is a widely used method for mapping intrinsic functional organization of the brain. Global signal regression (GSR) is commonly employed for removing systemic global variance from resting state BOLD-fMRI data; however, recent studies have demonstrated that GSR may introduce spurious negative correlations within and between functional networks, calling into question the meaning of anticorrelations reported between some networks. In the present study, we propose that global signal from resting state fMRI is composed primarily of systemic low frequency oscillations (sLFOs) that propagate with cerebral blood circulation throughout the brain. We introduce a novel systemic noise removal strategy for resting state fMRI data, "dynamic global signal regression" (dGSR), which applies a voxel-specific optimal time delay to the global signal prior to regression from voxel-wise time series. We test our hypothesis on two functional systems that are suggested to be intrinsically organized into anticorrelated networks: the default mode network (DMN) and task positive network (TPN). We evaluate the efficacy of dGSR and compare its performance with the conventional "static" global regression (sGSR) method in terms of (i) explaining systemic variance in the data and (ii) enhancing specificity and sensitivity of functional connectivity measures. dGSR increases the amount of BOLD signal variance being modeled and removed relative to sGSR while reducing spurious negative correlations introduced in reference regions by sGSR, and attenuating inflated positive connectivity measures. We conclude that incorporating time delay information for sLFOs into global noise removal strategies is of crucial importance for optimal noise removal from resting state functional connectivity maps.},

   abstract = {Smoking is the preferred method of administration for two of the most frequently abused drugs, marijuana and nicotine. The high temporal and spatial resolution of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) make it a natural choice for studying the neurobiological effects of smoked drugs if the challenges of smoking in a magnetic resonance (MR) scanner can be overcome. We report on a design for an MR-compatible smoking device that can be used for smoking marijuana (or tobacco) during fMRI examinations. Nine volunteers smoked marijuana cigarettes (3.51% Delta(9)-THC) on two occasions: with and without the device. The device allowed subjects to smoke while they lay in the scanner, while containing all smoke and odors. Plasma Delta(9)-THC, subjective reports of intoxication, and heart rate increases are reported, and were all similar in individuals smoking marijuana either with or without the device. The use of this device will help advance research studies on smoked drugs including marijuana, tobacco and crack cocaine. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Prior proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) studies have consistently reported decreased brain n-acetyl aspartate (NAA) levels and increased myo-inositol (mI) levels in subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD) relative to healthy comparison subjects. These studies have usually been conducted in small and homogeneous populations of patients with established Alzheimer's disease. Few studies have tested the usefulness of this finding in a general population seeking evaluation for memory loss and other cognitive declines. We designed a study to evaluate the significance of single-voxel proton MRS findings in these patients with memory loss and other cognitive declines. GENERAL METHOD: Thirty-five subjects with a primary complaint of memory loss and other cognitive declines were consecutively referred over a period of 13 months to a specialty clinic. Patients with a diagnosis of mild to moderate probable Alzheimer's disease (N = 22), non-Alzheimer's dementia (depression, multiinfarct dementia, Parkinson's Disease, Korsakoff's Psychosis, and bipolar disorder; N = 13), and healthy comparison subjects (N = 18) were examined with respect to possible differences in metabolites using proton MRS in a 3.4-ml anterior temporal lobe voxel. FINDINGS: The Alzheimer's disease group had 10.7% lower NAA/creatine (Cr) ratios relative to the healthy comparison group and 9.4% lower NAA/creatine relative to the non-Alzheimer's dementia group (15.0% lower NAA/creatine relative to the depression subgroup of the non-Alzheimer's dementia group). There were no significant differences in choline (Cho) or myo-inositol ratios among the groups. There were significant correlations between NAA/creatine ratios and mini-mental status exam (MMSE) scores in subjects with Alzheimer's disease (t = 2.41, p = 0.032) but not in subjects with non-Alzheimer's dementia or in its depression subgroup. CONCLUSIONS: This study found a reduction in the neuronal marker NAA in the anterior temporal lobe of patients diagnosed with probable Alzheimer's disease, using a short add-on proton MRS exam. This change was not observed in patients whose memory loss and other cognitive declines were not attributed to Alzheimer's disease, suggesting that it may aid in the diagnosis or detection of Alzheimer's disease.},

   abstract = {Purpose: Prior proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) studies have consistently reported decreased brain n-aceryl aspartate (NAA) levels and increased myo-inositol (ml) levels in subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD) relative to healthy comparison subjects. These studies have usually been conducted in small and homogeneous populations of patients with established Alzheimer's disease. Few studies have tested the usefulness of this finding in a general population seeking evaluation for memory loss and other cognitive declines. We designed a study to evaluate the significance of single-voxel proton MRS findings in these patients with memory loss and other cognitive declines. General method: Thirty-five subjects with a primary complaint of memory loss and other cognitive declines were consecutively referred over a period of 13 months to a specialty clinic. Patients with a diagnosis of mild to moderate probable Alzheimer's disease (N=22), non-Alzheimer's dementia (depression, multiinfarct dementia, Parkinson's Disease, Korsakoff's Psychosis, and bipolar disorder; N=13), and healthy comparison subjects (N=18) were examined with respect to possible differences in metabolites using proton MRS in a 3.4-ml anterior temporal lobe voxel. Findings: The Alzheimer's disease group had 10.7% lower NAA/creatine (Cr) ratios relative to the healthy comparison group and 9.4% lower NAA/creatine relative to the non-Alzheimer's dementia group (15.0% lower NAA/creatine relative to the depression subgroup of the non-Alzheimer's dementia group).

   abstract = {Confounding noise in BOLD fMRI data arises primarily from fluctuations in blood flow and oxygenation due to cardiac and respiratory effects, spontaneous low frequency oscillations (LFO) in arterial pressure. and non-task related neural activity. Cardiac noise is particularly problematic, as the low sampling frequency of BOLD fMRI ensures that these effects are aliased in recorded data. Various methods have been proposed to estimate the noise signal through measurement and transformation of the cardiac and respiratory waveforms (e.g. RETROICOR and respiration volume per time (RVT)) and model-free estimation of noise variance through examination of spatial and temporal patterns. We have previously demonstrated that by applying a voxel-specific time delay to concurrently acquired near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) data, we can generate regressors that reflect systemic blood flow and oxygenation fluctuations effects. Here, we apply this method to the task of removing physiological noise from BOLD data. We compare the efficacy of noise removal using various sets of noise regressors generated from NIRS data, and also compare the noise removal to RETROICOR+RVT. We compare the results of resting state analyses using the original and noise filtered data, and we evaluate the bias for the different noise filtration methods by computing null distributions from the resting data and comparing them with the expected theoretical distributions. Using the best set of processing choices, six NIRS-generated regressors with voxel-specific time delays explain a median of 10.5% of the variance throughout the brain, with the highest reductions being seen in gray matter. By comparison, the nine RETROICOR+RVT regressors together explain a median of 6.8% of the variance in the BOLD data. Detection of resting state networks was enhanced with NIRS denoising, and there were no appreciable differences in the bias of the different techniques. Physiological noise regressors generated using Regressor Interpolation at Progressive Time Delays (RIPTiDe) offer an effective method for efficiently removing hemodynamic noise from BOLD data.

   abstract = {Smoking is the preferred method of administration for two of the most frequently abused drugs, marijuana and nicotine. The high temporal and spatial resolution of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) make it a natural choice for studying the neurobiological effects of smoked drugs if the challenges of smoking in a magnetic resonance (MR) scanner can be overcome. We report on a design for an MR-compatible smoking device that can be used for smoking marijuana (or tobacco) during fMRI examinations. Nine volunteers smoked marijuana cigarettes (3.51% Delta9-THC) on two occasions: with and without the device. The device allowed subjects to smoke while they lay in the scanner, while containing all smoke and odors. Plasma Delta9-THC, subjective reports of intoxication, and heart rate increases are reported, and were all similar in individuals smoking marijuana either with or without the device. The use of this device will help advance research studies on smoked drugs including marijuana, tobacco and crack cocaine.},

   abstract = {Substantial controversy persists in the literature concerning the physiologic consequences hypocapnia, or low partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO(2)). Invasive animal studies have demonstrated large pH increases (>0.25 U), phosphocreatine (PCr) decreases (>30%), and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) decreases (>10%) after hyperventilation (HV) (20 mm Hg PaCO(2)). However, using magnetic resonance spectroscopy, HV studies in awake humans have demonstrated only small pH changes ( approximately 0.05 U) and no changes in PCr or ATP. It remains important to ascertain whether this failure to detect PCr changes in human studies reflects a true absence of changes, or a limitation in data fidelity. The present study used a rapidly interleaved phosphorus-proton spectroscopy acquisition from large samples at high magnetic field (4 T), to measure pH, PCr, inorganic phosphate, beta-ATP, and lactate changes with high temporal and signal sensitivity. Five of six subjects had usable data. During 20 mins HV, PaCO(2) reached a minimum at 16 mins (17 mm Hg); however, the maximum pH change (+0.047) peaked earlier (14 mins). Maximal lactate increases were measured at 15 mins. By 10 mins, maximum changes were observed for PCr (-3.4%) and inorganic phosphate (+6.4%). No changes in beta-ATP were observed. The peak in pH, despite continued decreases in PaCO(2), suggests active buffering during HV. These data, and the small magnitude of early PCr and inorganic phosphate changes, do not support substantial energy compromise during HV. Other mitigating factors, such as anesthesia-induced deregulation of the cerebrovasculature, might have contributed to the exaggerated metabolic changes observed in previous animal investigations.},

   abstract = {Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is an increasingly important noninvasive method in neuroscience due to its high temporal resolution and ability to independently measure oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin. However, the relatively low spatial resolution of fNIRS makes it difficult to relate this signal to underlying anatomy. Simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can complement fNIRS with superior spatial resolution and the ability to image the entire brain, providing additional information to improve fNIRS localization. However, current simultaneous fMRI/fNIRS acquisition methods are not optimal, due to the poor physical compatibility of existing MR coils and fNIRS optodes. Here, we present a technique to manufacture a true multimodal fMRI/fNIRS probe in which both modalities can be used with maximal sensitivity. To achieve this, we designed custom MR coils with integral fNIRS optodes using three-dimensional printing. This multimodal probe can be used to optimize spatial ([Formula: see text]) and temporal resolution (2.5 Hz) of fMRI, and it provides maximal MRI sensitivity, while allowing for high flexibility in the location and density of fNIRS optodes within the area of interest. Phantom and human data are shown to confirm the improvement in sensitivity in both modalities. This probe shows promise for addressing fundamental questions of the relation of fNIRS to physiology.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Functional MRI (fMRI) blood-oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals result not only from neuronal activation, but also from nonneuronal physiological processes. These changes, especially in the low-frequency domain (0.01-0.2 Hz), can significantly confound inferences about neuronal processes. It is crucial to effectively identify these nuisance low-frequency oscillations (LFOs). METHOD: A high temporal resolution (repetition time, approximately 0.5 s) fMRI resting state study was conducted with simultaneous physiological measurements to compare LFOs measured directly by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in the periphery and three methods that model LFOs from the respiration or cardiac signal: 1) the respiration volume per time (RVT), 2) the respiratory variation (RVRRF), and 3) the cardiac variation method (HRCRF). The LFO noise regressors from these methods were compared temporally and spatially as well as in their denoising efficiency. RESULTS: Methods were not highly correlated with one another, temporally or spatially. The set of two NIRS LFOs combined explained over 13% of BOLD signal variance and explained equal or more variance than HRCRF and RVRRF or RVT combined (in 14 of 16 participants). CONCLUSION: LFOs collected using NIRS in the periphery contain distinct temporal and spatial information about the LFOs in BOLD fMRI that is not contained in current low-frequency denoising methods derived from respiration and cardiac pulsation.

   abstract = {Craving is a key aspect of drug dependence that is thought to motivate continued drug use. Numerous brain regions have been associated with craving, suggesting that craving is mediated by a distributed brain network. Whether an increase in subjective craving is associated with enhanced interactions among brain regions was evaluated using resting state functional magnetic imaging (fMRI) in nicotine dependent participants. We focused on craving-related changes in the orbital and medial prefrontal cortex (OMPFC) network, which also included the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) extending into the ventral striatum. Brain regions in the OMPFC network are not only implicated in addiction and reward, but, due to their rich anatomic interconnections, may serve as the site of integration across craving-related brain regions. Subjective craving and resting state fMRI were evaluated twice with an approximately 1 hour delay between the scans. Cigarette craving was significantly increased at the end, relative to the beginning of the scan session. Enhanced craving was associated with heightened coupling between the OMPFC network and other cortical, limbic, striatal, and visceromotor brain regions that are both anatomically interconnected with the OMPFC, and have been implicated in addiction and craving. This is the first demonstration confirming that an increase in craving is associated with enhanced brain region interactions, which may play a role in the experience of craving.},

   abstract = {The insula plays a critical role in maintaining nicotine dependence and reactivity to smoking cues. More broadly, the insula and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) are key nodes of the salience network (SN), which integrates internal and extrapersonal information to guide behavior. Thus, insula-dACC interactions may be integral in processing salient information such as smoking cues that facilitate continued nicotine use. We evaluated functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from nicotine-dependent participants during rest, and again when they viewed smoking-related images. Greater insula-dACC coupling at rest was significantly correlated with enhanced smoking cue-reactivity in brain areas associated with attention and motor preparation, including the visual cortex, right ventral lateral prefrontal cortex, and the dorsal striatum. In an independent cohort, we found that insula-dACC connectivity was stable over 1-h delay and was not influenced by changes in subjective craving or expired carbon monoxide, suggesting that connectivity strength between these regions may be a trait associated with heightened cue-reactivity. Finally, we also showed that insula reactivity to smoking cues correlates with a rise in cue-reactivity throughout the entire SN, indicating that the insula's role in smoking cue-reactivity is not functionally independent, and may actually represent the engagement of the entire SN. Collectively, these data provide a more network-level understanding of the insula's role in nicotine dependence and shows a relationship between inherent brain organization and smoking cue-reactivity.},

   abstract = {Reactivity to smoking-related cues may play a role in the maintenance of smoking behavior and may change depending on smoking status. Whether smoking cue-related functional MRI (fMRI) reactivity differs between active smoking and extended smoking abstinence states currently is unknown. We used fMRI to measure brain reactivity in response to smoking-related versus neutral images in 13 tobacco-dependent subjects before a smoking cessation attempt and again during extended smoking abstinence (52 +/- 11 days) aided by nicotine replacement therapy. Prequit smoking cue induced fMRI activity patterns paralleled those reported in prior smoking cue reactivity fMRI studies. Greater fMRI activity was detected during extended smoking abstinence than during the pre-quit [corrected] assessment subcortically in the caudate nucleus and cortically in prefrontal (BA 6, 8, 9, 10, 44, 46), [corrected] primary somatosensory (BA 1, 2, 3), temporal (BA 22), [corrected] parietal (BA 5, 7, 40), occipital (BA 17, 18), [corrected] and posterior cingulate (BA 31) cortex. These data suggest that during extended smoking abstinence, fMRI reactivity to smoking versus neutral stimuli persists in brain areas involved in attention, somatosensory processing, motor planning, and conditioned cue responding. In some brain regions, fMRI smoking cue reactivity is increased during extended smoking abstinence in comparison to the prequit state, which may contribute to persisting relapse vulnerability.},

Quantifying relationships between attentional biases to drug cues and dACC neurochemistry could aid in identifying neurobiological mechanisms associated with increased relapse vulnerability precipitated by drug cues. As gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) deficits have been linked to impaired cognition and addictive disorders, we hypothesized that reduced GABA in the dACC would be associated with increased attentional biases towards smoking-related cues. We confirmed this hypothesis among nicotine-dependent tobacco smokers by combining an offline behavioral measure of attentional bias with magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Smokers with the greatest attentional bias also experienced more negative affect during early nicotine withdrawal. Findings revealed a relationship between heightened reactivity to drug cues, and both decreasing dACC GABA and early withdrawal symptoms. Because reduced GABA function in frontal brain regions disrupt cognitive function, our findings suggest that smokers with diminished dACC GABA may lack the cognitive resources to successfully ignore highly salient distractors such as tobacco-related stimuli and therefore might be more prone to cue-induced relapse. This newly discovered relationship between dACC GABA and attentional bias provides evidence for a neurochemical target, which may aid smoking cessation in highly cue-reactive individuals.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Brain dysfunction in prefrontal cortex (PFC) and dorsal striatum (DS) contributes to habitual drug use. These regions are constituents of brain networks thought to be involved in drug addiction. To investigate whether networks containing these regions differ between nicotine dependent female smokers and age-matched female non-smokers, we employed functional MRI (fMRI) at rest. METHODS: Data were processed with independent component analysis (ICA) to identify resting state networks (RSNs). We identified a subcortical limbic network and three discrete PFC networks: a medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) network and right and left lateralized fronto-parietal networks common to all subjects. We then compared these RSNs between smokers and non-smokers using a dual regression approach. RESULTS: Smokers had greater coupling versus non-smokers between left fronto-parietal and mPFC networks. Smokers with the greatest mPFC-left fronto-parietal coupling had the most DS smoking cue reactivity as measured during an fMRI smoking cue reactivity paradigm. This may be important because the DS plays a critical role in maintaining drug-cue associations. Furthermore, subcortical limbic network amplitude was greater in smokers. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that prefrontal brain networks are more strongly coupled in smokers, which could facilitate drug-cue responding. Our data also are the first to document greater reward-related network fMRI amplitude in smokers. Our findings suggest that resting state PFC network interactions and limbic network amplitude can differentiate nicotine-dependent smokers from controls, and may serve as biomarkers for nicotine dependence severity and treatment efficacy.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Developing the means to identify smokers at high risk for relapse could advance relapse prevention therapy. We hypothesized that functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) reactivity to smoking-related cues, measured before a quit attempt, could identify smokers with heightened relapse vulnerability. METHODS: Before quitting smoking, 21 nicotine-dependent women underwent fMRI during which smoking-related and neutral images were shown. These smokers also were tested for possible attentional biases to smoking-related words using a computerized emotional Stroop (ES) task previously found to predict relapse. Smokers then made a quit attempt and were grouped based on outcomes (abstinence vs. slip: smoking > or = 1 cigarette after attaining abstinence). Prequit fMRI and ES measurements in these groups were compared. RESULTS: Slip subjects had heightened fMRI reactivity to smoking-related images in brain regions implicated in emotion, interoceptive awareness, and motor planning and execution. Insula and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) reactivity induced by smoking images correlated with an attentional bias to smoking-related words. A discriminant analysis of ES and fMRI data predicted outcomes with 79% accuracy. Additionally, smokers who slipped had decreased fMRI functional connectivity between an insula-containing network and brain regions involved in cognitive control, including the dACC and dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex, possibly reflecting reduced top-down control of cue-induced emotions. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the insula and dACC are important substrates of smoking relapse vulnerability.

Characterizing relationships between smoking-related attentional bias and brain reactivity to smoking images may help in identifying neural substrates critical to relapse vulnerability. To this end, we investigated putative relationships between interference effects in an offline smoking ES task and functional MRI (fMRI) measures of brain reactivity to smoking vs neutral images in women smokers. Positive correlations were found between attentional bias and reactivity to smoking images in brain areas involved in emotion, memory, interoception, and visual processing, including the amygdala, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, insula, and occipital cortex.

   abstract = {Nicotine dependence is a chronic and difficult to treat disorder. While environmental stimuli associated with smoking precipitate craving and relapse, it is unknown whether smoking cues are cognitively processed differently than neutral stimuli. To evaluate working memory differences between smoking-related and neutral stimuli, we conducted a delay-match-to-sample (DMS) task concurrently with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in nicotine-dependent participants. The DMS task evaluates brain activation during the encoding, maintenance and retrieval phases of working memory. Smoking images induced significantly more subjective craving, and greater midline cortical activation during encoding in comparison to neutral stimuli that were similar in content yet lacked a smoking component. The insula, which is involved in maintaining nicotine dependence, was active during the successful retrieval of previously viewed smoking versus neutral images. In contrast, neutral images required more prefrontal cortex-mediated active maintenance during the maintenance period. These findings indicate that distinct brain regions are involved in the different phases of working memory for smoking-related versus neutral images. Importantly, the results implicate the insula in the retrieval of smoking-related stimuli, which is relevant given the insula's emerging role in addiction.},

   abstract = {Background: Tobacco smoking is the leading preventable cause of death in the developed world. Identifying risk factors for smoking may lead to more effective treatments. Genome wide association studies revealed a relationship between development of nicotine dependence and a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP, rs16969968) of the nicotine acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) alpha-5 subunit gene (CHRNA5). The relationship between this SNP and other factors contributing to smoking behavior such as smoking cue reactivity is unclear. Methods: We assessed the role of rs16969968 on brain functional MRI (fMRI) reactivity to smoking cues by studying nicotine dependent women with the nicotine dependence 'risk' allele (A allele, N = 14) and without the 'risk' allele (G/G smokers, N = 10). Nicotine dependence severity, as assessed with the Fagerstrom test for nicotine dependence, smoking pack-years, and expired carbon monoxide levels, were equivalent in these groups. Results: We observed a group difference in fMRI reactivity; women without the A allele (G/G smokers) showed greater fMRI reactivity to smoking images in brain areas related to memory and habitual behavior such as the hippocampus and dorsal striatum. Conclusions: Our finding suggests that nicotine-dependent smokers lacking the rs16969968 A allele are more likely to recall smoking-related memories and engage in habitual responding to smoking cues than A allele smokers. Although more studies are necessary to determine the mechanism underlying and significance of this cue reactivity difference, these data suggest that smokers may develop and remain nicotine dependent due to different factors including genetics and cue reactivity. This finding may have implications for personalizing smoking treatment. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Several experimental approaches have been developed to use fMRI in anesthetized and awake animal subjects, each of which has its advantages and complexities. We sought to assess whether one particular method to scan alert postanesthetized animals can be used to assess fMRI effects of opioid agonists. To date, the use of fMRI as a method to compare pharmacological effects of opioid drugs has been limited. Such studies are important because mu and kappa opioid receptor agonists produce distinct profiles of behavioral effects related both to clinically desirable endpoints (e.g., analgesia) and to undesirable effects (e.g., abuse potential). This study sought to determine whether we could use our fMRI approach to compare acute effects of behaviorally equipotent (3.2 mug/kg) intravenous doses of fentanyl and U69,593 (doses that do not affect cardiorespiratory parameters). Scans were acquired in alert male cynomolgus macaques acclimated to undergo fMRI scans under restraint, absent excessive stress hormone increases. These opioid agonists activated bilateral striatal and nucleus accumbens regions of interest. At the dose tested, U69,593 induced greater left nucleus accumbens BOLD activation than fentanyl, while fentanyl activated left dorsal caudate nucleus more than U69,593.

   abstract = {A proton MR spectral editing technique employing a spatially localized, double-quantum filter (DQF) was used to measure gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the human brain at 1.5 T. The double-quantum method provided robust, single-shot suppression of uncoupled resonances from choline, creatine, and NAA and allowed detection of the gamma CH2 GABA (3.0 ppm) resonance with 30% efficiency. Spatial localization of the GABA measurement was achieved by incorporating PRESS localization within the double-quantum excitation and detection sequence, A calibration technique was developed to adjust the relative phases of the RF pulses to maximize the in vivo double-quantum detection efficiency for an arbitrary voxel location. The sequence efficiency, degree of suppression of uncoupled resonances, and characterization of the in vivo DQF technique was examined in phantom experiments and in a study of the occipital lobe of 10 normal subjects, The ratio of the 3.0-ppm GABA resonance to the 3.0-ppm creatine resonance was found to be 0.20 +/- 0.05 (SD).},

   abstract = {This study investigated the relationships of systemic low-frequency oscillations (sLFOs) measured at different peripheral sites in resting state, during passive leg raising (PLR), and during a paced breathing (PB) test. Twenty-five healthy subjects (21 to 57 years old; males: 13 and females: 12) were recruited for these experiments. During the experiments, the fluctuations of oxyhemoglobin concentration were measured at six peripheral sites (left and right toes, fingertips, and earlobes) using a multichannel near-infrared spectroscopy instrument developed by our group. We applied cross-correlation and frequency component analyses on the data. The results showed that the sLFO signals in the symmetric peripheral sites were highly correlated, with time delays close to zero, whereas the correlation coefficients decreased between the sLFO signals of asymmetric sites, with delays up to several seconds. Furthermore, in PLR/PB tests, we found that PB caused wider and more robust changes in hemoglobin concentrations at peripheral sites compared to PLR. Among six peripheral sites, earlobes were the most sensitive to these perturbations, followed by fingertips, and then toes. Lastly, we showed that the perturbation signals may have different coupling mechanisms than the sLFO signals. The study deepened our understanding of the sLFO signals and establishes baseline measures for developing perfusion biomarkers to assess peripheral vascular integrity.},

Much of the research on smoking reinforcement and the maintenance of tobacco smoking behavior have focused on nicotine; however, a number of other non-nicotine factors are likely to influence the reinforcing effects of smoked tobacco. A growing number of studies suggest that non-nicotine factors, through many pairings with nicotine, are partially responsible for the reinforcing effect of smoking. Additionally, both clinical studies and preclinical advances in our understanding of nicotinic receptor regulation suggest that abstinence from smoking may influence smoking reinforcement. These experiments were conducted for 2 reasons: to validate a MRI-compatible cigarette smoking device; and to simultaneously investigate the impact of nicotine, smoking-associated conditioned reinforcers, and smoking abstinence state on subjective ratings of smoking reinforcement. Participants smoked nicotine and placebo cigarettes through an fMRI compatible device in an overnight-abstinent state or in a nonabstinent state, after having smoked a cigarette 25minutes prior. Outcome measures were within-subject changes in physiology and subjective ratings of craving and drug effect during the smoking of nicotine or placebo cigarettes on different days in both abstinence states.

   abstract = {Several popularly abused drugs, such as nicotine (tobacco) and THC (triangle 9-tetrahydrocannabinol) (marihuana) are commonly self-administered by the smoked route. Although the neuronal substrates mediating the effect of smoked drugs are of interest, studies of their acute actions in living human brain has been difficult due to the unique constraints imposed by neuroimaging equipment and scanning environments. We have previously reported a device for the self-administration of smoked drugs with concurrent blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) fMRI imaging. Here we report improvements to the device which result in improved drug delivery to the smoker. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GCMS) analysis of nicotine recovered from filter extracts revealed that the amount of nicotine delivered to subjects smoking with our original device was reduced by approximately 44% compared to nicotine delivered by cigarettes smoked normally. Improvements were made to the smoke delivery component of our apparatus in an attempt to improve drug delivery, while not interfering with collection of MRI data. Nicotine plasma levels in 9 subjects smoking both with and without the improved smoking device in the laboratory were not significantly different. Similarly, the device produced no significant difference in either ratings of the subjective effects of nicotine, or changes in cardiovascular parameters in this experiment. The improved device does not interfere with typical drug effects produced by normal smoking. Phantom scans revealed that BOLD signal was not found to be altered by the (in-bore) installation and operation of the improved device. Preliminary data analysis of smoking induced changes in the BOLD response to visual stimulation suggest that this response is not affected by the improved device, the act of smoking, air puffing, nicotine, or other components of cigarette smoke. The improved device does not interfere with the collection of MRI neuroimaging data. Use of this device will facilitate investigations of the acute neuronal effects of smoked drugs.},

   abstract = {A rapid, in-plane image registration algorithm that accurately estimates and corrects for rotational and translational motion is described, This automated, one-pass method achieves its computational efficiency by decoupling the estimation of rotation and translation, allowing the application of rapid crosscorrelation and cross-spectrum techniques for the determination of displacement parameters, k-space regridding and modulation techniques are used for image correction as alternatives to linear interpolation, The performance of this method was analyzed with simulations and echo-planar image data from both phantoms and human subjects, The processing time for image registration on a Hewlett-Packard 735/125 is 7.5 s for a 128 x 128 pixel image and 1.7 s for a 64 x 64 pixel image, Imaging phantom data demonstrate the accuracy of the method (mean rotational error, -0.09 degrees; standard deviation = 0.17 degrees; range, -0.44 degrees to +0.31 degrees; mean translational error = -0.035 pixels; standard deviation = 0.054 pixels; range, -0.16 to +0.06 pixels). Registered human functional imaging data demonstrate a significant reduction in motion artifacts such as linear trends in pixel time series and activation artifacts due to stimulus-correlated motion, The advantages of this technique are its noniterative one-pass nature, the reduction in image degradation as compared to previous methods, and the speed of computation.},

   abstract = {Face detection, the perceptual capacity to identify a visual stimulus as a face before probing deeper into specific attributes (such as its identity or emotion), is essential for social functioning. Despite the importance of this functional capacity, face detection and its underlying brain mechanisms are not well understood. This study evaluated the roles that the cortical face processing system, which is identified largely through studying other aspects of face perception, play in face detection. Specifically, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the activations of the fusifom face area (FFA), occipital face area (OFA) and superior temporal sulcus (STS) when face detection was isolated from other aspects of face perception and when face detection was perceptually-equated across individual human participants (n=20). During face detection, FFA and OFA were significantly activated, even for stimuli presented at perceptual-threshold levels, whereas STS was not. During tree detection, however, FFA and OFA were responsive only for highly salient (i.e., high contrast) stimuli. Moreover, activation of FFA during face detection predicted a significant portion of the perceptual performance levels that were determined psychophysically for each participant. This pattern of result indicates that FFA and OFA have a greater sensitivity to face detection signals and selectively support the initial process of face vs. non-face object perception.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Alterations in choline and myo-inositol metabolism have been noted in bipolar disorder, and the therapeutic efficacy of lithium in mania may be related to these effects. We wished to determine the relationship between anterior cingulate cortex choline and myo-inositol levels, assessed using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI), and mood state in subjects with bipolar disorder. METHODS: Serial assessments of anterior cingulate cortex choline and myo-inositol metabolism were performed in nine subjects with bipolar disorder, taking either lithium or valproate, and 14 controls. Each bipolar subject was examined between one and four times (3.1 +/- 1.3). On the occasion of each examination, standardized ratings of both depression and mania were recorded. RESULTS: In the left cingulate cortex, the bipolar subjects' depression ratings correlated positively with MRSI measures of Cho/Cr-PCr. In the right cingulate cortex, the Cho/Cr-PCr ratio was significantly higher in subjects with bipolar disorder compared with control subjects. In addition, bipolar subjects not taking antidepressants had a significantly higher right cingulate cortex Cho/Cr-PCr ratio compared with patients taking antidepressants or controls. No clinical or drug-related changes were observed for the Ino/Cr-PCr ratio. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that bipolar disorder is associated with alterations in the metabolism of cytosolic, choline-containing compounds in the anterior cingulate cortex. As this resonance arises primarily from phosphocholine and glycerophosphocholine, both of which are metabolites of phosphatidylcholine, these results are consistent with impaired intraneuronal signaling mechanisms.},

We hypothesized that unmedicated children with BPD would have reduced glutamine and glutamate levels compared with HCSs and medicated children with BPD. Method: Spectra were acquired from the anterior cingulate cortex in 22 children and adolescents with DSM-IV-TR BPD, type 1 (13 female: age 12.6 4.4 years: 7 of the subjects with BPD were unmedicated at the time of the scan) and 10 HCSs (7 female: age 12.3 +/- 2.5 years). Results: Unmedicated subjects with BPD had significantly lower glutamine levels than HCSs or medicated subjects with BPD. There were no differences in glutamate levels between the three groups. Conclusions: These results are consistent with there being an abnormality in anterior cingulate cortex glia in untreated children and adolescents with BPD. The results of this pilot study may be important in helping us better understand the pathophysiology of child and adolescent BPD.

In particular, topiramate has been shown to increase occipital cortex GABA levels, as measured using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to measure the effect of acute oral topiramate on the GABA precursors glutamate and glutamine in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and occipital lobe (OL) using high-field (4.0 T) proton MRS (1H MRS). METHODS: Proton MR spectra were acquired from healthy men at three times: at baseline and 2 and 6 h after ingesting 50 (N=5) or 100 mg (N=5) of topiramate. Blood samples were acquired prior to each scan for the purpose of obtaining serum topiramate levels. RESULTS: A 100-mg dose of topiramate significantly increased ACC glutamine levels within 2 h of ingestion and OL glutamine levels within 6 h of ingestion. There were no measured significant effects of topiramate on ACC or OL glutamate levels. CONCLUSIONS: A 100-mg dose of oral topiramate increased serum topiramate and ACC glutamine levels within 2 h. OL glutamine levels increased within 6 h. Increased brain glutamine levels may be a consequence of topiramate positively modulating GABAA receptors.

   abstract = {A single-voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) method is described that enables the in vivo measurement of endogenous brain glycine (Gly) levels in human subjects. At 4.0 T, TE-averaging (1)H-MRS dramatically attenuates the overlapping myo-inositol (mI) resonances at 3.52 ppm, permitting a more reliable measure of the Gly singlet peak. This methodology initially is described and tested in phantoms. The phantom data infers that the 3.55-ppm peak predominantly is Gly with a smaller contribution from mI. The composite resonance thus is differentiated from pure Gly and mI and is labeled Gly*. The mI contribution was calculated as <2% of the total Gly* signal for a 1:1 mI/Gly mixture. The technique subsequently was used to acquire TE-averaged (1)H-MRS data from the occipital cortex of healthy control subjects. The resultant spectra closely resembled experimental phantom data. LC-model analysis provided a means for quantifying TE-averaged (1)H-MRS spectra and a mean test-retest variability measure of 15% was established for brain Gly* levels in studies of six healthy subjects.},

   abstract = {Objective: Studies of depressed adults have shown abnormalities in cerebral energy metabolism, as noted by low brain levels of nucleoside triphosphate (NTP), which primarily represents adenosine triphosphate (ATP). This study was undertaken to determine whether proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1 MRS) measures of the low-field purine resonance, which arises primarily from adenosine phosphates, can be used to assess abnormalities in cerebral purine metabolism in depressed adults. Method: Data from H-1 MRS and phosphorus-31 (P-31) MRS were acquired for depressed and nondepressed comparison subjects. Intensities of the purine resonance, by H-1 MRS (7.5-8.5 ppm), and of NTP by P-31 MRS, were determined. Results: Purine resonance intensities did not differ on average between depressed patients and comparison subjects. However, purine levels were approximately 30% lower in female depressed subjects who subsequently responded to fluoxetine treatment than in those who did not respond. Beta-NTP was lower by 21% in responders than in nonresponders and was correlated with purine levels for the depressed subjects. Conclusions: Brain purine levels are low in female depressed patients who respond to treatment with fluoxetine, suggesting that response to treatment might be predicted by using H-1 MRS. These observations also suggest that agents that increase brain adenosine levels may have antidepressant efficacy.},

   abstract = {Background and objective: The study of biodistribution and in situ pharmacokinetics is a challenging, but sometimes very important, aspect of premarketing characterization of drugs. We aimed to develop a non-invasive fluorine magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopic method for the absolute quantitation of a mono-fluorinated compound and of its metabolites in the heart and liver of healthy subjects for this purpose. Method: We used fluorine MR spectroscopy (MRS) at 4 T (Tesla) and external standardization in an open label multiple-dose study. Twenty-three healthy adult subjects were enrolled in the study. The surface coil localized fluorine MR spectrum was monitored in the heart and liver at baseline and after oral administration of multiple doses of tecastemizole. Steady-state measurements were made at set time points that depended upon dose, and washout measurements were made only on subjects in which in vivo fluorine signal was observed. Results and discussion: At 4 T, under the given experimental conditions, the method had a lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) of about 2.6 mu M and a limit of detection (LOD) of about 0.3 mu M for solution state samples (linewidth approximately 15 Hz). The measurement reproducibility was 6.4% using a 50 mu M phantom. The effect of MR operator and spectral analyst on the calculated calibration curve slope was small, with inter-rater correlation coefficients of 0.999 and 0.998 respectively. MR signal from fluorine-containing tecastemizole-related moieties was observed in situ only at day 8 in the liver of three of five subjects dosed at 270 mg/day. The average in situ concentration was estimated to be 58 +/- 22 mu M, with an average test-retest reproducibility of 216%. Extrapolating the in vitro results to human measurements, with an approximate linewidth of 250 Hz, predicts in situ LOD and LLOQ values of approximately 6 and 44 mu M respectively. However, the human study had a fluorine MRS LOD of approximately 20 mu M. The decrease in sensitivity and the increase in variability of the in vivo, in situ measurements compared with the validation study most likely arose from coil placement and incomplete rephasing of the MR signal by the respiratory phase compensation method. Conclusion: The measured concentrations were the lowest ever recorded for a multi-dose exogenous mono-fluorinated compound in the human liver using a validated fluorine MR quantitation method. The proposed non-invasive MR method for studying the biodistribution and in situ pharmacokinetics of mono-fluorinated compounds in the liver and heart should have broader application to the development of non-invasive biomarkers.},

   abstract = {Cerebrovascular reserve (CVR) reflects the compensatory dilatory capacity of cerebral vasculature to a dilatory stimulus. Blood oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) fMRI has been proven to be an effective imaging technique to obtain CVR maps when subjects perform CO(2) inhalation or a breath-holding (BH) task. Here we propose a novel way to process the fMRI data obtained during a blocked BH task by using simultaneously collected near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) data as regressors to estimate the vascular contribution to the BOLD signal. Six healthy subjects underwent a 6min 30s resting state (RS) fMRI scan, followed by a scan of the same duration with a blocked BH task (5 breath holds with 20s durations separated by ~50s of regular breathing). NIRS data were recorded from a probe over the subjects' right prefrontal area. For each scan, the time course of changes in total hemoglobin (Delta[tHb]) was calculated from the NIRS data, time shifted by various amounts, and resampled to the fMRI acquisition rate. Each shifted time course was used as regressor in a general linear model analysis. The maximum parameter estimate across all time shifts was calculated at all voxels in both the BH and RS scans, and then converted into signal percentage changes. The ratio of these signal changes generates a CVR map of the BH response, normalized to the resting state. The NIRS regressor method makes no assumptions about the shape (or presence) of the BH response, and allows direct, quantitative comparison of the vascular BOLD response to BH to the baseline map obtained in the resting state.},

   abstract = {Low frequency oscillations (LFOs), characterized by frequencies in the range 0.01-0.1 Hz are commonly observed in blood-related brain functional measurements such as near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). While their physiological origin and implications are not fully understood, these signals are believed to reflect some types of neuronal signaling, systemic hemodynamics, and/or cerebral vascular auto-regulation processes. Here, we examine a new method of integrated processing of concurrent NIRS and fMRI data collected on six human subjects during a whole brain resting state acquisition. The method combines the high spatial resolution offered by fMRI (approximately 3mm) and the high temporal resolution offered by NIRS (approximately 80 ms) to allow for the quantitative assessment of temporal relationships between the LFOs observed at different spatial locations in fMRI data. This temporal relationship allowed us to infer that the origin of a large proportion of the LFOs is independent of the baseline neural activity. The spatio-temporal pattern of LFOs detected by NIRS and fMRI evolves temporally through the brain in a way that resembles cerebral blood flow dynamics. Our results suggest that a major component of the LFOs arise from fluctuations in the blood flow and hemoglobin oxygenation at a global circulatory system level.},

   abstract = {The blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal in functional MRI (fMRI) reflects both neuronal activations and global physiological fluctuations. These physiological fluctuations can be attributed to physiological low frequency oscillations (pLFOs), respiration, and cardiac pulsation. With typical TR values, i.e., 2 s or longer, the high frequency physiological signals (i.e., from respiration and cardiac pulsation) are aliased into the low frequency band, making it hard to study the individual effect of these physiological processes on BOLD. Recently developed multiband EPI sequences, which offer full brain coverage with extremely short TR values (400 ms or less) allow these physiological signals to be spectrally separated. In this study, we applied multiband resting state scans on nine healthy participants with TR = 0.4 s. The spatial distribution of each physiological process on BOLD fMRI was explored using their spectral features and independent component analysis (ICA). We found that the spatial distributions of different physiological processes are distinct. First, cardiac pulsation affects mostly the base of the brain, where high density of arteries exists. Second, respiration affects prefrontal and occipital areas, suggesting the motion associated with breathing might contribute to the noise. Finally, and most importantly, we found that the effects of pLFOs dominated many prominent ICA components, which suggests that, contrary to the popular belief that aliased cardiac and respiration signals are the main physiological noise source in BOLD fMRI, pLFOs may be the most influential physiological signals. Understanding and measuring these pLFOs are important for denoising and accurately modeling BOLD signals.},

   abstract = {Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measures changes in blood oxygenation, which is affected by physiological processes, including cardiac pulsation, breathing, and low frequency oscillations (LFO). It is challenging to identify spatial and temporal effects of these processes on the BOLD signal because the low sampling rate of BOLD leads to aliasing of higher frequency physiological signal components. In this study, we used concurrent functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and fMRI on 6 subjects during a resting state scan. To reduce aliasing, the BOLD fMRI acquisition was repeatedly performed on a set of sequentially acquired slice stacks to lower the TR to 0.5s while retaining high spatial resolution. Regressor interpolation at progressive time delays (RIPTiDe) method was used, in which physiological signal acquired by fNIRS (without aliasing) and its temporal shifts were used as regressors in the fMRI analysis to determine the magnitude and timing of the effects of various physiological processes on the BOLD signal. The details of the timing of the passage of the cardiac pulsation wave and of the cerebral blood itself were mapped. The result suggests that the cardiac signal affects the voxels near large blood vessels (arteries and veins) most strongly, while LFO mostly affected the drainage veins. We hypothesize that this could be the result of differences in the cerebral blood path lengths, and differences in the dynamics of the propagation of the signals. Together these results validate and extend a novel imaging technique to dynamically track the pulse-wave and bulk blood flow with concurrent fMRI and fNIRS.},

   abstract = {BOLD functional MRI (fMRI) data are dominated by low frequency signals, many of them of unclear origin. We have recently shown that some portions of the low frequency oscillations found in BOLD fMRI are systemic signals closely related to the blood circulation (Tong et al. [2013]: NeuroImage 76:202-215). They are commonly treated as physiological noise in fMRI studies. In this study, we propose and test a novel data-driven analytical method that uses these systemic low frequency oscillations in the BOLD signal as a tracer to follow cerebral blood flow dynamically. Our findings demonstrate that: (1) systemic oscillations pervade the BOLD signal; (2) the temporal traces evolve as the blood propagates though the brain; and, (3) they can be effectively extracted via a recursive procedure and used to derive the cerebral circulation map. Moreover, this method is independent from functional analyses, and thus allows simultaneous and independent assessment of information about cerebral blood flow to be conducted in parallel with the functional studies. In this study, the method was applied to data from the resting state scans, acquired using a multiband EPI sequence (fMRI scan with much shorter TRs), of seven healthy participants. Dynamic maps with consistent features resembling cerebral blood circulation were derived, confirming the robustness and repeatability of the method.},

   abstract = {It is widely accepted that the fluctuations in resting state blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) functional MRI (fMRI) reflect baseline neuronal activation through neurovascular coupling; this data is used to infer functional connectivity in the human brain during rest. Consistent activation patterns, i.e., resting state networks (RSN) are seen across groups, conditions, and even species. In this study, we show that some of these patterns can also be generated from the dynamic, systemic, non-neuronal physiological low frequency oscillations (sLFOs) in the BOLD signal alone. We have previously used multimodal imaging to demonstrate the wide presence of the same sLFOs in the brain (BOLD) and periphery with different time delays. This study shows that these sLFOs from BOLD signals alone can give rise to stable spatial patterns, which can be detected during resting state analyses. We generated synthetic resting state data for 11 subjects based only on subject-specific, dynamic sLFO information obtained from resting state data using concurrent peripheral optical imaging or a novel recursive procedure. We compared the results obtained by performing a group independent component analysis (ICA) on this synthetic data (i.e., the result from simulation) to the results obtained from analysis of the real data. ICA detected most of the eight well-known RSNs, including visual, motor, and default mode networks (DMNs), in both the real and the synthetic data sets. These findings suggest that RSNs may reflect, to some extent, vascular anatomy associated with systemic fluctuations, rather than neuronal connectivity.},

The results show the wide spatial distribution of this physiological fluctuation in BOLD data, both in task and resting states. The brain areas that are highly correlated with global physiological fluctuations observed by fNIRS have a pattern that resembles the venous system of the brain, indicating the blood fluctuation from veins on the brain surface might strongly contribute to the overall fNIRS signal.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Recently developed simultaneous multislice echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequences permit imaging of the whole brain at short repetition time (TR), allowing the cardiac fluctuations to be fully sampled in blood-oxygen-level dependent functional MRI (BOLD fMRI). A novel low computational analytical method was developed to dynamically map the passage of the pulsation signal through the brain and visualize the whole cerebral vasculature affected by the pulse signal. This algorithm is based on a simple combination of fast BOLD fMRI and the scanner's own built-in pulse oximeter. METHODS: Multiple, temporally shifted copies of the pulse oximeter data (with 0.08 s shifting step and coverage of a 1-s span) were downsampled and used as cardiac pulsation regressors in a general linear model based analyses (FSL) of the fMRI data. The resulting concatenated z-statistics maps show the voxels that are affected as the cardiac signal travels through the brain. RESULTS: Many voxels were highly correlated with the pulsation regressor or its temporally shifted version. The dynamic and static cardiac pulsation maps obtained from both the task and resting state scans, resembled cerebral vasculature. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated: (i) cardiac pulsation significantly affects most voxels in the brain; (ii) combining fast fMRI and this analytical method can reveal additional clinical information to functional studies.},

   abstract = {Blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signals are widely used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as a proxy measure of brain activation. However, because these signals are blood-related, they are also influenced by other physiological processes. This is especially true in resting state fMRI, during which no experimental stimulation occurs. Previous studies have found that the amplitude of resting state BOLD is closely related to regional vascular density. In this study, we investigated how some of the temporal fluctuations of the BOLD signal also possibly relate to regional vascular density. We began by identifying the blood-bound systemic low-frequency oscillation (sLFO). We then assessed the distribution of all voxels based on their correlations with this sLFO. We found that sLFO signals are widely present in resting state BOLD signals and that the proportion of these sLFOs in each voxel correlates with different tissue types, which vary significantly in underlying vascular density. These results deepen our understanding of the BOLD signal and suggest new imaging biomarkers based on fMRI data, such as amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and sLFO, a combination of both, for assessing vascular density.},

   abstract = {Independent component analysis (ICA) is widely used in resting state functional connectivity studies. ICA is a data-driven method, which uses no a priori anatomical or functional assumptions. However, as a result, it still relies on the user to distinguish the independent components (ICs) corresponding to neuronal activation, peripherally originating signals (without directly attributable neuronal origin, such as respiration, cardiac pulsation and Mayer wave), and acquisition artifacts. In this concurrent near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)/functional MRI (fMRI) resting state study, we developed a method to systematically and quantitatively identify the ICs that show strong contributions from signals originating in the periphery. We applied group ICA (MELODIC from FSL) to the resting state data of 10 healthy participants. The systemic low frequency oscillation (LFO) detected simultaneously at each participant's fingertip by NIRS was used as a regressor to correlate with every subject-specific IC time course. The ICs that had high correlation with the systemic LFO were those closely associated with previously described sensorimotor, visual, and auditory networks. The ICs associated with the default mode and frontoparietal networks were less affected by the peripheral signals. The consistency and reproducibility of the results were evaluated using bootstrapping. This result demonstrates that systemic, low frequency oscillations in hemodynamic properties overlay the time courses of many spatial patterns identified in ICA analyses, which complicates the detection and interpretation of connectivity in these regions of the brain.},

   abstract = {Independent component analysis (ICA) is widely used in resting state functional connectivity studies. ICA is a data-driven method, which uses no a priori anatomical or functional assumptions. However, as a result, it still relies on the user to distinguish the independent components (ICs) corresponding to neuronal activation, peripherally originating signals (without directly attributable neuronal origin, such as respiration, cardiac pulsation and Mayer wave), and acquisition artifacts. In this concurrent near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)/functional MRI (fMRI) resting state study, we developed a method to systematically and quantitatively identify the ICs that show strong contributions from signals originating in the periphery. We applied group ICA (MELODIC from FSL) to the resting state data of 10 healthy participants. The systemic low frequency oscillation (LFO) detected simultaneously at each participant's fingertip by NIRS was used as a regressor to correlate with every subject-specific IC time course. The ICs that had high correlation with the systemic LFO were those closely associated with previously described sensorimotor, visual, and auditory networks. The ICs associated with the default mode and frontoparietal networks were less affected by the peripheral signals. The consistency and reproducibility of the results were evaluated using bootstrapping. This result demonstrates that systemic, low frequency oscillations in hemodynamic properties overlay the time courses of many spatial patterns identified in ICA analyses, which complicates the detection and interpretation of connectivity in these regions of the brain.},

   abstract = {Cerebrovascular reserve (CVR) reflects the compensatory dilatory capacity of cerebral vasculature to a dilatory stimulus. Blood oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) fMRI has been proven to be an effective imaging technique to obtain CVR maps when subjects perform CO(2) inhalation or a breath-holding (BH) task. Here we propose a novel way to process the fMRI data obtained during a blocked BH task by using simultaneously collected near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) data as regressors to estimate the vascular contribution to the BOLD signal. Six healthy subjects underwent a 6 min 30 s resting state (RS) fMRI scan, followed by a scan of the same duration with a blocked BH task (5 breath holds with 20s durations separated by similar to 50 s of regular breathing). NIRS data were recorded from a probe over the subjects' right prefrontal area. For each scan, the time course of changes in total hemoglobin (Delta[tHb]) was calculated from the NIRS data, time shifted by various amounts, and resampled to the fMRI acquisition rate. Each shifted time course was used as regressor in a general linear model analysis. The maximum parameter estimate across all time shifts was calculated at all voxels in both the BH and RS scans, and then converted into signal percentage changes. The ratio of these signal changes generates a CVR map of the BH response, normalized to the resting state. The NIRS regressor method makes no assumptions about the shape (or presence) of the BH response, and allows direct, quantitative comparison of the vascular BOLD response to BH to the baseline map obtained in the resting state.

While their physiological origin and implications are not fully understood, these signals are believed to reflect some types of neuronal signaling, systemic hemodynamics. and/or cerebral vascular auto-regulation processes Here, we examine a new method of integrated processing of concurrent NIRS and fMRI data collected on six human subjects during a whole brain resting state acquisition The method combines the high spatial resolution offered by fMRI (similar to 3 mm) and the high temporal resolution offered by NIRS (similar to 80 ms) to allow for the quantitative assessment of temporal relationships between the LFOs observed at different spatial locations in fMRI data This temporal relationship allowed us to infer that the origin of a large proportion of the LFOs is independent of the baseline neural activity The spatio-temporal pattern of LFOs detected by NIRS and fMRI evolves temporally through the brain in a way that resembles cerebral blood flow dynamics. Our results suggest that a major component of the LFOs arise from fluctuations in the blood flow and hemoglobin oxygenation at a global circulatory system level (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measures changes in blood oxygenation, which is affected by physiological processes, including cardiac pulsation, breathing, and low frequency oscillations (LFO). It is challenging to identify spatial and temporal effects of these processes on the BOLD signal because the low sampling rate of BOLD leads to aliasing of higher frequency physiological signal components. In this study, we used concurrent functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and fMRI on 6 subjects during a resting state scan. To reduce aliasing, the BOLD fMRI acquisition was repeatedly performed on a set of sequentially acquired slice stacks to lower the TR to 0.5 s while retaining high spatial resolution. Regressor interpolation at progressive time delays (RIPTiDe) method was used, in which physiological signal acquired by fNIRS (without aliasing) and its temporal shifts were used as regressors in the fMRI analysis to determine the magnitude and timing of the effects of various physiological processes on the BOLD signal. The details of the timing of the passage of the cardiac pulsation wave and of the cerebral blood itself were mapped. The result suggests that the cardiac signal affects the voxels near large blood vessels (arteries and veins) most strongly, while LFO mostly affected the drainage veins. We hypothesize that this could be the result of differences in the cerebral blood path lengths, and differences in the dynamics of the propagation of the signals. Together these results validate and extend a novel imaging technique to dynamically track the pulse-wave and bulk blood flow with concurrent fMRI and fNIRS. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

   abstract = {Physiological fluctuations at low frequency (<0.1 Hz) are prominent in functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) measurements in both resting state and functional task studies. In this study, we used the high spatial resolution and full brain coverage of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to understand the origins and commonalities of these fluctuations. Specifically, we applied a newly developed method, regressor interpolation at progressive time delays, to analyze concurrently recorded fNIRS and fMRI data acquired both in a resting state study and in a finger tapping study. The method calculates the voxelwise correlations between blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) fMRI and fNIRS signals with different time shifts and localizes the areas in the brain that highly correlate with the fNIRS signal recorded at the surface of the head. The results show the wide spatial distribution of this physiological fluctuation in BOLD data, both in task and resting states. The brain areas that are highly correlated with global physiological fluctuations observed by fNIRS have a pattern that resembles the venous system of the brain, indicating the blood fluctuation from veins on the brain surface might strongly contribute to the overall fNIRS signal.

   abstract = {It is widely known that blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) contrast in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is an indirect measure for neuronal activations through neurovascular coupling. The BOLD signal is also influenced by many non-neuronal physiological fluctuations. In previous resting state (RS) fMRI studies, we have identified a moving systemic low frequency oscillation (sLFO) in BOLD signal and were able to track its passage through the brain. We hypothesized that this seemingly intrinsic signal moves with the blood, and therefore, its dynamic patterns represent cerebral blood flow. In this study, we tested this hypothesis by performing Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast (DSC) MRI scans (i.e. bolus tracking) following the RS scans on eight healthy subjects. The dynamic patterns of sLFO derived from RS data were compared with the bolus flow visually and quantitatively. We found that the flow of sLFO derived from RS fMRI does to a large extent represent the blood flow measured with DSC. The small differences, we hypothesize, are largely due to the difference between the methods in their sensitivity to different vessel types. We conclude that the flow of sLFO in RS visualized by our time delay method represents the blood flow in the capillaries and veins in the brain.},

   abstract = {Previous studies have found that aperiodic, systemic low-frequency oscillations (sLFOs) are present in blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) data. These signals are in the same low frequency band as the "resting state" signal; however, they are distinct signals which represent non-neuronal, physiological oscillations. The same sLFOs are found in the periphery (i.e. finger tips) as changes in oxy/deoxy-hemoglobin concentration using concurrent near-infrared spectroscopy. Together, this evidence points toward an extra-cerebral origin of these sLFOs. If this is the case, it is expected that these sLFO signals would be found in the carotid arteries with time delays that precede the signals found in the brain. To test this hypothesis, we employed the publicly available MyConnectome dataset (a two-year longitudinal study of a single subject) to extract the sLFOs in the internal carotid arteries (ICAs) with the help of the T1/T2-weighted images. Significant, but negative, correlations were found between the LFO BOLD signals from the ICAs and (1) the global signal (GS), (2) the superior sagittal sinus, and (3) the jugulars. We found the consistent time delays between the sLFO signals from ICAs, GS and veins which coincide with the blood transit time through the cerebral vascular tree.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Surgical revascularization is often performed in patients with moyamoya, however routine tools for efficacy evaluation are underdeveloped. The gold standard is digital subtraction angiography (DSA); however, DSA requires ionizing radiation and procedural risk, and therefore is suboptimal for routine surveillance of parenchymal health. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether parenchymal vascular compliance measures, obtained noninvasively using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), provide surrogates to revascularization success by comparing measures with DSA before and after surgical revascularization. METHODS: Twenty surgical hemispheres with DSA and MRI performed before and after revascularization were evaluated. Cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR)-weighted images were acquired using hypercapnic 3-Tesla gradient echo blood oxygenation level-dependent MRI. Standard and novel analysis algorithms were applied (i) to quantify relative CVR (rCVRRAW), and decompose this response into (ii) relative maximum CVR (rCVRMAX) and (iii) a surrogate measure of the time for parenchyma to respond maximally to the stimulus, CVRDELAY. Measures between time points in patients with good and poor surgical outcomes based on DSA-visualized neoangiogenesis were contrasted (signed-rank test; significance: 2-sided P < .050). RESULTS: rCVRRAW increases (P = .010) and CVRDELAY decreases (P = .001) were observed pre- vs post-revascularization in hemispheres with DSA-confirmed collateral formation; no difference was found pre- vs post-revascularization in hemispheres with poor revascularization. No significant change in rCVRMAX post-revascularization was observed in either group, or between any of the MRI measures, in the nonsurgical hemisphere. CONCLUSION: Improvement in parenchymal compliance measures post-revascularization, primarily attributed to reductions in microvascular response time, is concurrent with collateral formation visualized on DSA, and may be useful for longitudinal monitoring of surgical outcomes.},

Because the majority of negative studies have used adolescent samples, it has been suggested that chronicity is a necessary condition for such findings. To test the hypothesis that a smaller hippocampus in PTSD is unrelated to comorbid alcoholism or to chronicity, this study estimated hippocampal volume in a relatively large group ( N=99) of combat veterans in which PTSD, lifetime alcohol abuse/dependence, and Vietnam versus Gulf War service were crossed. In subjects with histories of alcoholism, unadjusted hippocampal volume was 9% smaller in persons with PTSD than in those without PTSD. In nonalcoholic subjects, the PTSD-related difference in hippocampal volume was 3%. The failure to observe a strong association between PTSD and hippocampal volume in nonalcoholic subjects was not ascribable to younger age, reduced PTSD chronicity, or lower PTSD symptom severity. The possibility that smaller hippocampal volume is limited to groups in which PTSD is compounded by comorbid alcoholism is not necessarily incompatible with results suggesting a smaller hippocampus is predispositional to PTSD.
